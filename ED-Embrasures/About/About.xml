Adds embrasures for that can be shot through, while blocking passage.

There is an issue with raiders not targeting people behind Embrasures caused by optimisation in the vanilla targeting. I strongly advise that you look into the mod "I've Got You In My Sights" that is a fix for this issue and helps greatly to balance Embrasures. Thanks to DonationBox, spdskatr and Brrainz for working on this.
