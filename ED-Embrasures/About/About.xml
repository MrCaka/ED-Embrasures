Discussion, Non Steam Downloads and GitHub Repositories of this mod is available at: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=18995
Please Use that Thread for Discussion / Feedback that would like me to reply to. 
Ideally Bugs should be logged on GitHub although in the discussion thread is also fine.

Adds embrasures for that can be shot through, while blocking passage.
