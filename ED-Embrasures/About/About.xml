Please Use that Thread for Discussion / Feedback that would like me to reply to. 
Ideally Bugs should be logged on GitHub although in the discussion thread is also fine.

Adds embrasures for that can be shot through, while blocking passage.

This is an issue with raiders not targeting people behind Embrasures caused by optimisation in the vanilla targeting. I strongly advise that you look into the mod "I've Got You In My Sights" that is a fix for this issue and helps greatly to balance Embrasures. Thanks to DonationBox, spdskatr and Brrainz for working on this.
